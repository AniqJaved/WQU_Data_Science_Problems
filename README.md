# WQU_Data_Science_Problems
In the WorldQuant University i was able to successfully complete all the problems. The mini projects are as follows:
## Problem_1
Learners compute Mersenne numbers in Python and apply the Lucas-Lehmer test to determine which Mersenne numbers are prime. 
To create their approach, they had to leverage Python data structures and essential programming techniques like for loops. 
They also had to develop Eratosthenes' Sieve as a speedier way to determine if numbers are prime.
## Problem_2
Learners created a class that depicts a geometric point using Object Oriented Programming. They define techniques for typical point 
operations like adding two points together and calculating the distance between two points.  They developed a K-means clustering method 
that takes advantage of the previously determined point class.
## Problem_3
Learners used the Python programme pandas to analyse data from the British National Health Service's prescription medication database. 
They responded to questions such as determining which practitioners prescribe opioids at an unusually high rate and which practitioners
prescribe significantly more uncommon medications than the rest. They identified the  behaviours using statistical concepts such as the z-score.
## Problem_4
Learners utilised fundamental Python data structures, functions, and control programme flow to respond to queries on prescription medicine data 
from the British NHS. They have to apply basic data manipulation techniques including connecting data sets together, grouping data, and aggregating 
data into summary statistics.
